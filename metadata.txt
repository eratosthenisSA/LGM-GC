about=This plugin implements a Machine Learning workflow for training classification algorithms on annotated datasets that contain mappings between coordinate pairs and the ideal geocoding source for them and producing models for providing accurate predictions about ideal geocoding sources for previously unseen geocoding pairs. Geocoding implements a series of training features, regarding the different coordinate pairs that are available for each geocoder and the interaction between them and neighboring geospacial data (namely road data).
